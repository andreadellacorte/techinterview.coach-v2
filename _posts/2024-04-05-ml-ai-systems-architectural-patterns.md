As the adoption of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow across industries, the need for robust, scalable, and well-designed ML/AI systems has become increasingly crucial. Gone are the days when ML/AI were relegated to standalone, experimental projects. Today, these technologies are mission-critical components integrated into the core of many applications and systems. Ensuring the reliability, performance, and maintainability of these ML/AI systems is paramount to their success.

### ML/AI:

**1\. How LinkedIn Detects Spam Content:**

LinkedIn employs a sophisticated system for detecting spam posts and updates on their platform. This system leverages a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of posts, machine learning models to identify patterns indicative of spam, and heuristics to flag suspicious behavior. Additionally, human moderation workflows are in place to review and take action on flagged content, ensuring that legitimate posts are not incorrectly marked as spam.
