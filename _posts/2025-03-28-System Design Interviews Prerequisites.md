In our previous article, we outlined the expectations and distinct approaches required for junior engineers, senior professionals and architects—during system design interviews. Understanding these role-specific expectations is crucial, but to effectively meet them, it's essential to grasp the foundational concepts that underpin successful system design. This article delves into the key prerequisite knowledge and principles you need to master to excel in system design interviews across different levels of seniority. Whether you're preparing for your first interview or aiming to advance to a principal architect role, these essential concepts will equip you with the tools to design robust, efficient, and scalable systems. By building a strong foundation, you'll be better positioned to tackle complex design challenges and demonstrate the expertise expected at each career stage.

## Tips for Each Level

**Junior**

- Focus on clear explanation of simple systems.

- Demonstrate understanding of why certain components are chosen (e.g., database type, caching).<br>

**Senior**

- Show awareness of trade-offs (latency vs. consistency, cost vs. performance).

- Illustrate ability to deep dive into specific areas (e.g., designing a robust data storage layer).<br>

**Architect**

- Demonstrate a big-picture approach: how parts fit together, scaling globally, cost, security, organization-wide strategies.

- Show leadership in managing risk, complexity, and future-proofing the design.<br>

## Final Thoughts

System design interviews test both breadth (knowledge of many different components and services) and depth (ability to dive deep into key areas like databases, caching, microservices, etc.). As you move from junior to architect-level roles, the expectation moves from constructing a workable solution at small scale to designing, operating, and evolving complex, global systems that handle massive scale, stringent SLAs, and multiple stakeholders.

Use the lists above as a study guide, but remember that real-world experience—building and scaling systems in production—often stands out more than textbook knowledge alone. Good luck!
