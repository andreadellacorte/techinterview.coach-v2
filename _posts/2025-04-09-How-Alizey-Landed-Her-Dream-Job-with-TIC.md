The road to landing a dream job at **Amazon** is tough—even for talented professionals. Alizey had the skills, but after two failed attempts, she knew she needed a new approach. That’s when she turned to **Tech Interview Coaching**.

The result? A complete transformation in how she showed up to interviews—and the outcome changed her life.

> "Hande’s coaching was transformative. She didn’t just help me prepare for Amazon’s rigorous interviews—she made the process human, boosting my confidence and keeping me motivated. It felt like working with a mentor and friend who truly cared."

## The Wake-Up Call: When Skills Aren’t Enough

Alizey had already tried twice to break into Amazon. She wasn’t lacking in capability—what she needed was **a strategy to frame her story and demonstrate impact**.

> “I knew I was doing something wrong because I wasn’t getting through. That’s when I decided to seek professional help.”

She joined [Tech Interview Coaching](https://techinterview.coach/?utm_campaign=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_source=article), where she worked with [Hande](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/handeormen) and [Andrea](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/andreadellacorte), two expert coaches who specialize in helping engineers and product leaders succeed at high-stakes interviews.

## Aligning with Amazon: Crafting Stories That Stick

A big focus of the coaching was translating Alizey’s real-world experience into concise, high-impact stories that mapped directly to [Amazon’s Leadership Principles](https://techinterview.coach/blog/dive-deep/?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article).

> “They helped me rewrite my stories to focus on what mattered. I learned to keep things brief while ensuring my answers aligned with Amazon’s expectations.”

This wasn’t about memorising answers. It was about storytelling with precision—showcasing ownership, problem-solving, and bias for action in ways that interviewers could immediately recognize and value.

## Human First: Building Confidence Through Coaching

Confidence is often the hidden factor behind a great interview. For Alizey, managing nerves was half the battle—and Hande’s approach made all the difference.

> “Hande humanized the process for me. She took the time to acknowledge my emotions and gave me pep talks that shifted my mindset entirely.”

With that shift, Alizey walked into each round calmer, more grounded, and better able to think clearly under pressure.

## Mock Interviews: Simulating the Real Thing

What made the biggest impact? Practice under real pressure.

Through several rounds of **mock interviews**, Alizey got direct feedback on her answers, delivery, and pacing.

> “The mock interviews were intense, but they prepared me for the real thing. By the time I walked into the actual interview, I felt ready for anything.”

Each session helped her sharpen her responses, anticipate curveballs, and build the stamina for multi-round interview loops.

## The Result: An Offer from Amazon

When interview day finally came, Alizey delivered—calm, confident, and razor-sharp.

> “It felt surreal. After all the hard work, to finally get the offer was amazing.”

She didn’t just pass the interviews—she stood out.

## Post-Interview Support: Negotiating the Offer

The coaching didn’t stop at the offer stage. Hande and Andrea supported Alizey through **negotiation**, helping her assess the total compensation package and secure a deal she felt great about.

> “They didn’t just stop at the interviews. They were there for me every step of the way, even after I got the offer.”

## Alizey’s Advice for Tech Professionals

For anyone preparing for FAANG or top-tier roles, Alizey has clear takeaways:

1. **Invest in Coaching**  
   “If you’re struggling with interviews, investing in a coach is worth it. They help you see things from the interviewer’s perspective.”

2. **Study the Company’s Values**  
   “Understand what the company cares about, and tailor your responses accordingly.”

3. **Rehearse, Refine, Repeat**  
   “Mock interviews made all the difference. They helped me refine my answers and reduce my anxiety.”

4. **It’s More Than a Job**  
   “Coaching isn’t just about getting hired. It builds lasting confidence and clarity.”
