The role of a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is one of the most coveted positions in the tech industry. But what does it take to become a successful CTO? In our webinar series [_“The Final Round”_](https://www.youtube.com/@TechInterviewCoach) hosted by Tech Interview Coaching, Adelina Chalmers, also known as [_The Geek Whisperer_](https://www.geekwhisperer.co.uk/adelina-chalmers), shared her expert insights on this topic. Adelina is a guest lecturer at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a renowned expert in helping engineers transition into executive roles, providing actionable advice for aspiring CTOs.

Here are some key takeaways from the webinar:

## The Path to Becoming a CTO

Adelina emphasized that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to becoming a CTO. She outlined five common paths she’s observed among the hundreds of CTOs she’s worked with:

**Startup Founder:** Many CTOs start as co-founders of startups, leveraging their technical expertise to build a company.

**Volunteering for Leadership Roles:** In larger companies, engineers can progress by volunteering for leadership tasks and expressing their career goals to managers.

**Being the First Engineer:** Some CTOs are promoted from within when a company grows and the original CTO leaves.

**Tech Consulting:** Building a reputation as a consultant can lead to CTO roles.

**Networking:** Strong networking skills can open doors to CTO positions, even for those who may not be the most technically skilled.

Adelina also highlighted that many people with the title of CTO are _“accidental CTOs”_ who lack the executive skills required for the role. True CTOs, she explained, have a track record of advancing from engineering to management and executive roles.

## The Importance of Soft Skills

One of the biggest challenges for CTOs is bridging the gap between technical expertise and executive leadership. Adelina stressed the importance of communication, political acumen, and emotional intelligence.

**Communication:** Avoid using technical jargon when speaking to executives. Instead, focus on translating technical concepts into business terms.

**Political Acumen:** Learn how to deliver bad news effectively. Always provide a solution or action plan when presenting challenges to the board.

**Emotional Intelligence:** Understand your own emotions and how others perceive you. This self-awareness is crucial for building trust and credibility.

## The Role of AI and the Future of CTOs

With the rise of AI, the role of the CTO is evolving. Adelina noted that while AI can handle technical tasks, it cannot replace the soft skills and strategic thinking required of a CTO. The ability to inspire teams, influence stakeholders, and communicate effectively will become even more critical as AI advances.

## Advice for Aspiring CTOs

For those looking to climb the ladder, Adelina shared the following tips:

**Be Curious:** Ask questions about how your work impacts the company’s bottom line.

**Volunteer for Leadership Opportunities:** Take on projects that allow you to develop management and executive skills.

**Network:** Attend industry events and build relationships with key players in your field.

## Women in Tech and CTO Roles

Adelina also addressed the under-representation of women in tech leadership roles. She emphasized the importance of inclusion and mentorship, encouraging companies to create opportunities for women to succeed.
