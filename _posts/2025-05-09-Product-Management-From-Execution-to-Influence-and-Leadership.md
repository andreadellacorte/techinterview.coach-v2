In today’s fast-paced tech world, product managers are no longer just shipping features — they’re strategic thinkers, cross-functional influencers, and visionary leaders. This webinar, part of [The Final Round](https://www.youtube.com/@TechInterviewCoach) webinar series hosted by Tech Interview Coaching, dives deep into how PMs can evolve from executional workhorses to influential leaders. Our guest, [Ivetta](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/ivetadulova), Senior Product Manager, joined [Hande Ormen](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/handeormen) to share her journey and tactical insights on scaling as a PM.

## From Engineer to Product Leader

Ivetta’s path into product management is a story many can relate to. Starting her career as a software engineer at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/jobs/current-jobs), she gradually became fascinated with *why* things were built — not just *how*. This curiosity guided her into product management, where she now leverages her technical roots to build impactful products at scale.
Her journey reinforces that PMs don’t all follow the same playbook, and non-linear paths are more common than you think.

## The PM Trap: Stuck in Execution Mode

According to recent data shared in the session, 79% of PMs feel stuck in execution, and only 34% feel they hold real executive influence. Ivetta explained that constantly reacting to [Slack](https://slack.com/) messages and back-to-back meetings are red flags.

If you’re not carving out time for long-term thinking, you’re likely just keeping the lights on — not driving real value.

**Early signs you're stuck in execution:**

- You don’t have time to think about product direction

- Strategy is always being postponed

- You’re always reacting, never proactively shaping the roadmap


## Common Misconceptions About Scaling as a PM

- You have to do everything
 ➤ Learn to let go. Start small. Drop a task and see what happens — often, it’s nothing.

- High visibility = micromanagement
 ➤ Influence comes from understanding the “why” behind leadership’s asks and diplomatically negotiating scope and timelines.

- Leadership is about having all the answers
 ➤ It’s actually about asking the right questions and creating clarity where there is none.


## Tools & Frameworks for Strategic Thinking

There’s no one-size-fits-all, but Ivetta recommends trying frameworks like:

- North Star Metrics for vision anchoring

- Weighted Scoring & RICE for prioritization

- Behavioral analytics to validate product-market fit


**Her tool stack includes:**

- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article) (custom views & filters for visibility)

- [Trello](https://trello.com/?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article) / [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article) (for ideation & light planning)

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article) & AI tools (for brainstorming, summarizing, and early drafts)


## Thinking Like a Strategic PM

PM success isn't just about shipping features — it's about solving real business problems.

- Shift your thinking from:
“Did I ship X?”
To:
“Did we move the needle on Y business outcome?”

Ivetta emphasizes aligning with stakeholders through storytelling, business impact, and internal marketing. Build relationships before you need them — host coffee chats, hold lunch-and-learns, and proactively get ahead of blockers.


## Influencing Without Authority

PMs rarely have formal power, but they must build influence. Here’s how:

- Understand what drives your teammates
 Motivate engineers by showing them the impact of their work.

- Manage up
 Speak leadership's language: data, ROI, and market outcomes.

- Practice skip-level communication
 Use one-on-ones to elevate the visibility of your work (be concise, be strategic).

“You have to show business impact. There is no substitute.” – Ivetta


## Ivetta’s Must-Read Book List

- Dare to Lead – Brené Brown
 ➤ Rethinking leadership through empathy and vulnerability.

- Hooked – Nir Eyal
 ➤ Understand what makes users come back to your product.

- Empowered – Marty Cagan
 ➤ Building truly innovative teams and collaboration frameworks.

- Product Leadership – Richard Banfield
 ➤ Roadmapping, stakeholder management, and developing your PM voice.


## Career Risk: Not Scaling

PMs who remain in execution mode too long risk career stagnation. Leadership roles go to those who can think big, influence outcomes, and demonstrate strategic impact.

But not every PM has to become a VP — success can also mean being a domain expert with deep impact in a niche.


## Watch the Full Webinar

Scaling as a PM is part mindset, part system design. It’s about letting go of perfectionism, embracing ambiguity, and finding leverage through people and process.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Protect your strategic thinking time

- Build relationships early

- Know your product’s why — and make it visible
