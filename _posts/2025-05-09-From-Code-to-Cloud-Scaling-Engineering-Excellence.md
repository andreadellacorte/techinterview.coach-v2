In today's rapidly evolving tech world, **cloud-native architecture** is more than just a buzzword—it's a critical component of modern engineering. In the latest episode of our [The Final Round](https://www.youtube.com/@TechInterviewCoach) webinar series hosted by Tech Interview Coaching, [Hande Ormen](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/handeormen), Co-Founder and CMO of Tech Interview Coaching, sat down with Sid, an accomplished former Principal Engineering Manager from [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/home.html). Together, they explored what it takes to build, scale, and succeed in the cloud era.

Hande introduced [Sid](https://techinterview.coach/coaches/sidray), highlighting his impressive journey: multiple years at Microsoft, patents in cloud computing, and significant experience interviewing and coaching candidates for **FAANG-level positions**. Sid’s deep expertise in system design, algorithms, distributed systems, and leadership coaching made him the perfect guest for this crucial conversation.

## Why Cloud-Native Matters

Sid broke down why **cloud-native architecture** is pivotal today:

- **Scalability, resiliency, and speed** are the lifeblood of modern systems.

- **Microservices architecture ensures flexibility:** if one service fails, the whole system doesn't collapse.

- **Containers and orchestration** (like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/?utm_campaign=blog_promotion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=article)) optimize hardware usage and streamline development.

- **Security, performance, and cost optimization** are not optional—they are critical pillars for every modern cloud application.

Sid also drew from his experience managing Azure JIT services, a core part of Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, serving 80 global regions.

## Real-World Lessons from Microsoft

Sid shared a behind-the-scenes look at solving **real-world challenges**:

- A **Severity 2 (SEV2) incident** due to overwhelming traffic load caused service degradation. Diagnosing and solving the issue involved understanding **Swiss Cheese models** in distributed systems—where multiple small failures align to cause a major incident.

- **Auto-scaling**, though powerful, can still lag behind **exponential surges** in traffic if not correctly configured.

- During major migrations (like moving from Cosmos DB to a relational SQL system), **unexpected technical hurdles** such as implementing optimistic concurrency control (ETag) had to be solved.


Sid emphasized that **scalability and security** require meticulous planning, not just good intentions.

## Career Tips for Aspiring Cloud Engineers

For those looking to **break into cloud engineering**, Sid outlined a practical path:

- **Master the fundamentals:** Linux basics, networking, Git, security concepts.

- **Get hands-on with cloud platforms:** Pick one — [AWS](), [Azure](), or [GCP]() — and build real projects.

- **Learn infrastructure as code** tools like [Terraform]().

- **Contribute to open-source projects** for deeper experience.

- **Focus on depth over breadth:** Knowing a few areas deeply is better than shallow familiarity with many.

He also emphasized that **real-world project experience** beats certifications alone when it comes to impressing hiring managers.

## What Hiring Managers Are Looking For

When Sid hired engineers at Microsoft, he looked for:

- **Structured thinking under pressure:** Can you break down a complex problem?

- **Strong communication skills:** Can you think out loud, clarify assumptions, and engage collaboratively?

- **Real technical depth:** Personal GitHub projects matter, but open-source contributions are even more impactful.

Behavioral traits like **humility, curiosity, and succinctness** were just as critical as technical excellence.

## Navigating Modern Cloud Challenges

Sid answered critical questions from the audience:

- **Managing monolith to microservices transitions** requires strong service mesh implementation, observability, and careful architecture.

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is crucial for securing cloud services.

- **Remote work** is still possible in cloud engineering, but junior engineers often benefit from on-site mentorship.

He also emphasized that while engineering roles have been more resilient during tech downturns, **continuous learning** and **delivering high-quality** results are essential for career survival and growth.

## Sid’s Must-Read Book Recommendations

Sid recommended these essential reads:

- **Distributed Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum —** the bible for understanding complex systems.

- **Introduction to Algorithms —** foundational knowledge for every software engineer.

- **The First 90 Days —** for successfully onboarding into a new role.

How to Win Friends and Influence People — a timeless guide to professional relationships.
